I don't plan on maintaining this past it's usefulness.

I don't plan on helping people with problems.

I don't plan on making a tutorial video.

It's mostly for me to have a working backup of a blank forge mod that i can can start from and know it's going to work

It also isn't really in the realm of best practice in any sense, example: the logger was giving me an error on running the client, so I commented it out.

about:

==========================


A download and go version of a basic empty example mod for forge using forge mdk with parchment and intellij.

This is mainly for skipping most of the setup issues between intellij forge and parchment so i can just download it, load it in to intellij and go.

I figured I'd share it so that anyone can download it and start modding and skip all that headache.
